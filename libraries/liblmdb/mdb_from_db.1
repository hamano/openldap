.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B mdb_from_db
utility reads from a Berkeley DB environment
.BR berkeley.db
and from_dbs all its subdatabases, or just the specified
.BR subdb
, into the
LMDB environment
.BR envpath .

Additionally,
.B mdb_from_db
may write in the
.B -T
plain text format understood by
.BR mdb_load (1)
which can only understand a single subdatabase at a time.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-V
Write the library version number to the standard output, and exit.
.TP
.BR \-n
From_Db an LMDB database which does not use subdirectories.
.TP
.BR \-s \ subdb
From_Db a specific subdatabase. If no database is specified, data is from_dbed into the main database.
.TP
.BR \-N
Don't overwrite existing records when from_dbing into an already existing database; just skip them.
.TP
.BR \-b \ sz
Commit LMDB records
.B sz
at a time.
.TP
.BR \-h \ db_homedir
Treat input db path as relative to this homedir (see the Berkeley DB docs). Default is '.'
.TP
.BR \-B
Perform a nonblocking Berkeley DB open.
.TP
.BR \-T
Write the key/data into a single simple text file (stderr messages
would allow segmenting the output into separate files for each
subdatabase). The input will be paired lines of text, where the first
line of the pair is the key item, and the second line of the pair is
its corresponding data item. If more than one database is read then
refer to the counts reported on stderr.

A simple escape mechanism, where newline and backslash (\\) characters
are special, is applied to the text input. Newline characters are
interpreted as record separators.  Backslash characters in the text
will be interpreted in one of two ways: If the backslash character
precedes another backslash character, the pair will be interpreted as
a literal backslash. If the backslash character precedes any other
character, the two characters following the backslash will be
interpreted as a hexadecimal specification of a single character; for
example, \\0a is a newline character in the ASCII character set.

For this reason, any backslash or newline characters that naturally
occur in the text input must be escaped to avoid misinterpretation by
.BR mdb_load.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Exit status is zero if no errors occur.
Errors result in a non-zero exit status and
a diagnostic message being written to standard error.

Information about each subdatabase processed, and the total number of
records is also written to standard error.
